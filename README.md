# How to use
This repository is based around the construction of a fully and partially autonomous quadcopter, mostly for educational purposes. The primary goal is to solve as many problems as you feel competent to solve, and thereby improve your knowledge until you can run the vehicle entirely on your own software. Perhaps this vehicle has no advantages over existing drones, but it's far more customizable, and most importantly, its your code!
